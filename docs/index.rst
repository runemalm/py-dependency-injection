    While features are stable, some minor adjustments may occur before the final release.

py-dependency-injection
=======================

A dependency injection library for Python.

Purpose
-------

Dependency injection is a powerful design pattern that promotes loose coupling and enhances testability in software applications. `py-dependency-injection` is a prototypical implementation of this pattern, designed to provide the essential features needed for effective dependency management in both small scripts and larger software projects.

This library is particularly suited for beginners exploring the concept of dependency injection, as it offers a straightforward and easy-to-understand implementation. It serves as an excellent starting point for learning the pattern and can also be used as a foundational base for frameworks requiring a more specialized interface for dependency injection.

Key Advantages
--------------

- **Suitable for Learning:** Ideal for beginners exploring the concept of dependency injection.
- **Base Implementation for Frameworks:** Can be used as a foundational base for frameworks requiring a more specialized interface for dependency injection.
- **Standalone Solution:** Can also be used on its own, as a fully-featured dependency injection solution in any software project.
